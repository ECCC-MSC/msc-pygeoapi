# Architecture diagrams

The architecture diagrams in this directory are designed using the [C4 model](https://c4model.com) for visualising software architecture.

The diagrams are saved as an editable .png file, for easy default viewing on GitHub, showing the last active diagram when saved. Any PNG
viewer will also render the diagram in the same way. The diagrams can be updated using [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net).
