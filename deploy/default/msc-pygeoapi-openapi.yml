      description: The Marine Standard Forecast Zones layer is a collection of forecast
        location polygons that represents bounded (zone) locations at the Marine Program
        Standard level. The Marine Program standard level is used in most forecasts,
        warnings, watches, advisories and special marine weather statements. This
        layer is comprised mainly of water based Marine regions, Met Areas, Lakes,
        Great Lakes and many of the larger Inland water bodies. The layer is further
        comprised of four depictions, cartographic detailed (with proper shorelines
        and high resolution polygons), cartographic coarse (with generalized shorelines
        and low resolution polygons), and digital exaggerated (with exaggerated shorelines
        and low resolution polygons) and the hybrid (mix of cartographic detail and
        exaggerated). The digital layer (exaggerated) is a collection of polygons
        where shoreline boundaries are stretched inland. In this "Exaggerated" part
        of the layer, the boundaries are made smooth to reduce the number of polygon
        vertices. Boundaries of the forecast regions of this hybrid set are derived
        from the polygon boundaries of both the exaggerated digital, and the cartographic
        detailed set. Polygon boundaries along the shoreline of this set follow the
        exaggerated boundaries while the inland boundaries follow the detailed lines.
        The Marine Standard Forecast Zones layer is also presented in the polygon
        package in two coordinate systems, "Projected" (Lambert Conic Conformal) and
        "Unprojected" (Geographical Coordinated System).

      description: The Marine Standard Forecast Zones layer is a collection of forecast
        location polygons that represents bounded (zone) locations at the Marine Program
        Standard level. The Marine Program standard level is used in most forecasts,
        warnings, watches, advisories and special marine weather statements. This
        layer is comprised mainly of water based Marine regions, Met Areas, Lakes,
        Great Lakes and many of the larger Inland water bodies. The layer is further
        comprised of four depictions, cartographic detailed (with proper shorelines
        and high resolution polygons), cartographic coarse (with generalized shorelines
        and low resolution polygons), and digital exaggerated (with exaggerated shorelines
        and low resolution polygons) and the hybrid (mix of cartographic detail and
        exaggerated). The digital layer (exaggerated) is a collection of polygons
        where shoreline boundaries are stretched inland. In this "Exaggerated" part
        of the layer, the boundaries are made smooth to reduce the number of polygon
        vertices. Boundaries of the forecast regions of this hybrid set are derived
        from the polygon boundaries of both the exaggerated digital, and the cartographic
        detailed set. Polygon boundaries along the shoreline of this set follow the
        exaggerated boundaries while the inland boundaries follow the detailed lines.
        The Marine Standard Forecast Zones layer is also presented in the polygon
        package in two coordinate systems, "Projected" (Lambert Conic Conformal) and
        "Unprojected" (Geographical Coordinated System).

        weather statement. With the exception of the Manitoba Lakes, the layer is
        made up of mostly the land kind of polygons. The layer is made up of four
        depictions, cartographic detailed (with proper shorelines and high resolution
        polygons), cartographic coarse (with generalized shorelines and low resolution
        polygons), digital exaggerated (with exaggerated shorelines and low resolution
        polygons) and the hybrid (mix of cartographic detail and exaggerated). The
        digital layer (exaggerated) is a collection of polygons where shoreline boundaries
        are stretched offshore for the land polygons and inland for the water polygons.
        In this "Exaggerated" layer, the boundaries are made smooth to reduce the
        number of polygon vertices. Boundaries of the forecast regions of this hybrid
        set are derived from the polygon boundaries of both the exaggerated digital,
        and the cartographic detailed set. Polygon boundaries along the shoreline
        of this set follow the exaggerated boundaries while the inland boundaries
        follow the detailed lines. The Public Standard Forecast Zones layer is presented
        in the polygon package in two coordinate systems, "Projected" (Lambert Conformal
        Conic) and "Unprojected" (Geographical Coordinated System).

      description: The Public Standard Forecast Zones layer is a collection of public
        program forecast location zone polygons that represents bounded measurable
        locations at the Public program Standard level. The public program standard
        level is used in most forecasts, warnings, watches, advisories and special
        weather statement. With the exception of the Manitoba Lakes, the layer is
        made up of mostly the land kind of polygons. The layer is made up of four
        depictions, cartographic detailed (with proper shorelines and high resolution
        polygons), cartographic coarse (with generalized shorelines and low resolution
        polygons), digital exaggerated (with exaggerated shorelines and low resolution
        polygons) and the hybrid (mix of cartographic detail and exaggerated). The
        digital layer (exaggerated) is a collection of polygons where shoreline boundaries
        are stretched offshore for the land polygons and inland for the water polygons.
        In this "Exaggerated" layer, the boundaries are made smooth to reduce the
        number of polygon vertices. Boundaries of the forecast regions of this hybrid
        set are derived from the polygon boundaries of both the exaggerated digital,
        and the cartographic detailed set. Polygon boundaries along the shoreline
        of this set follow the exaggerated boundaries while the inland boundaries
        follow the detailed lines. The Public Standard Forecast Zones layer is presented
        in the polygon package in two coordinate systems, "Projected" (Lambert Conformal
        Conic) and "Unprojected" (Geographical Coordinated System).

      description: The Thunderstorm Outlook is a graphical or GeoJSON forecast product,

        Outlooks are issued by storm prediction centres across Canada during the convective
        season (May to October) each year. Both the graphical and GeoJSON products
        use the same source data that forecasters enter through the Ninjo software.
        Thunderstorm Outlooks are issued once per day at around 12:00 pm regional
        local time. Since each office has their own standards of procedure, the forecasters
        are not required to send it at 12:00 pm. Nonetheless, the timestamp in the
        data is preconfigured to say it is issued at 12:00 pm in the GeoJSON product.
        Subsequent amendments to existing Thunderstorm Outlooks are issued on an as-needed
        basis during the day. Each amendment generates a new GeoJSON file and graphical
        product. The Thunderstorm Outlook may not be updated with active severe weather
        alerts. Users are asked to check with the latest watches and warnings for
        the most current conditions.

      description: The Thunderstorm Outlook is a graphical or GeoJSON forecast product,

        Outlooks are issued by storm prediction centres across Canada during the convective
        season (May to October) each year. Both the graphical and GeoJSON products
        use the same source data that forecasters enter through the Ninjo software.
        Thunderstorm Outlooks are issued once per day at around 12:00 pm regional
        local time. Since each office has their own standards of procedure, the forecasters
        are not required to send it at 12:00 pm. Nonetheless, the timestamp in the
        data is preconfigured to say it is issued at 12:00 pm in the GeoJSON product.
        Subsequent amendments to existing Thunderstorm Outlooks are issued on an as-needed
        basis during the day. Each amendment generates a new GeoJSON file and graphical
        product. The Thunderstorm Outlook may not be updated with active severe weather
        alerts. Users are asked to check with the latest watches and warnings for
        the most current conditions.

        the absence of a post-processed forecast for wind direction could also be
        due to weak forecasted wind components preventing the calculation of reliable
        results. The forecasts of wind speed and direction are produced from independent
        statistical post-processing models. Geographical coverage includes weather
        stations across Canada. Statistically post-processed forecasts is available
        at the same frequency of emission as the numerical model producing the raw
        forecasts and at 3-hourly lead times for the RDPS.

- description: The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is a scale designed to help quantify
    the quality of the air in a certain region on a scale from 1 to 10. When the amount
    of air pollution is very high, the number is reported as 10+. It also includes
    a category that describes the health risk associated with the index reading (e.g.
    Low, Moderate, High, or Very High Health Risk). The AQHI is calculated based on
    the relative risks of a combination of common air pollutants that are known to
    harm human health, including ground-level ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen
    dioxide. The AQHI formulation captures only the short term or acute health risk
    (exposure of hour or days at a maximum). The formulation of the AQHI may change
    over time to reflect new understanding associated with air pollution health effects.
    The AQHI is calculated from data observed in real time, without being verified

- description: Statistical post-processing of weather and environmental forecasts
    issued by numerical models, including the Global Deterministic Prediction System
    (GDPS), reduces systematic bias and error variance of raw numerical forecasts.
    This is achieved by establishing an optimal relationship between observations
    recorded at stations and co-located numerical model outputs. The Updatable Model
    Output Statistics (UMOS) system at Environment Canada carries out this task. The
    statistical relationships are built using the Model Output Statistics (MOS) method
    and a multiple linear regression (MLR) technic. The weather and environmental
    variable being statistically post-processed by UMOS consists of air temperature
    at approximately 1.5 meters above ground. The absence of a statistically post-processed
    forecast can be caused by a missing statistical model due to insufficient observation
    data quality or quantity. Geographical coverage includes weather stations across

- description: Statistical post-processing of weather and environmental forecasts
    issued by numerical models, including the Regional Deterministic Prediction System
    (RDPS), reduces systematic bias and error variance of raw numerical forecasts.
    This is achieved by establishing an optimal relationship between observations
    recorded at stations and co-located numerical model outputs. The Updatable Model
    Output Statistics (UMOS) system at Environment Canada carries out this task. The
    statistical relationships are built using the Model Output Statistics (MOS) method
    and a multiple linear regression (MLR) technic. The weather and environmental
    variables being statistically post-processed by UMOS include air temperature and
    dew point temperature at approximately 1.5 meters above ground as well as wind
    speed and direction at 10 meters above ground or at the anemometer level in the
    case of a buoy. The absence of a statistically post-processed forecast can be
    caused by a missing statistical model due to insufficient observation data quality
    or quantity. In addition, the absence of a post-processed forecast for wind direction
    could also be due to weak forecasted wind components preventing the calculation
    of reliable results. The forecasts of wind speed and direction are produced from
    independent statistical post-processing models. Geographical coverage includes
    weather stations across Canada. Statistically post-processed forecasts is available
    at the same frequency of emission as the numerical model producing the raw forecasts
    and at 3-hourly lead times for the RDPS.

    station data (i.e., AHCCD datasets). Homogenized climate data incorporate adjustments
    to the original station data to account for discontinuities from non-climatic
    factors, such as instrument changes or station relocation. Annual trends of relative
    total precipitation change (%) for 1948-2012 based on Canadian gridded data (CANGRD)
    are available, at a 50km resolution across Canada. The relative trends reflect
    the percent change in total precipitation over a period from the baseline value
    (defined as the average over 1961-1990 as the reference period). Annual trends
    of mean surface air temperature change (degrees Celsius) for 1948-2016 based on
    Canadian gridded data (CANGRD) are available at a 50km resolution across Canada.

- description: The Public Standard Forecast Zones layer is a collection of public
    program forecast location zone polygons that represents bounded measurable locations
    at the Public program Standard level. The public program standard level is used
    in most forecasts, warnings, watches, advisories and special weather statement.
    With the exception of the Manitoba Lakes, the layer is made up of mostly the land
    kind of polygons. The layer is made up of four depictions, cartographic detailed
    (with proper shorelines and high resolution polygons), cartographic coarse (with
    generalized shorelines and low resolution polygons), digital exaggerated (with
    exaggerated shorelines and low resolution polygons) and the hybrid (mix of cartographic
    detail and exaggerated). The digital layer (exaggerated) is a collection of polygons
    where shoreline boundaries are stretched offshore for the land polygons and inland
    for the water polygons. In this "Exaggerated" layer, the boundaries are made smooth
    to reduce the number of polygon vertices. Boundaries of the forecast regions of
    this hybrid set are derived from the polygon boundaries of both the exaggerated
    digital, and the cartographic detailed set. Polygon boundaries along the shoreline
    of this set follow the exaggerated boundaries while the inland boundaries follow
    the detailed lines. The Public Standard Forecast Zones layer is presented in the
    polygon package in two coordinate systems, "Projected" (Lambert Conformal Conic)
    and "Unprojected" (Geographical Coordinated System).

    mainly of water based Marine regions, Met Areas, Lakes, Great Lakes and many of
    the larger Inland water bodies. The layer is further comprised of four depictions,
    cartographic detailed (with proper shorelines and high resolution polygons), cartographic
    coarse (with generalized shorelines and low resolution polygons), and digital
    exaggerated (with exaggerated shorelines and low resolution polygons) and the

- description: The Thunderstorm Outlook is a graphical or GeoJSON forecast product,
    which depicts the expected geographic areas of thunderstorms in Canada. Thunderstorm
    Outlooks are issued by storm prediction centres across Canada during the convective
    season (May to October) each year. Both the graphical and GeoJSON products use
    the same source data that forecasters enter through the Ninjo software. Thunderstorm
    Outlooks are issued once per day at around 12:00 pm regional local time. Since
    each office has their own standards of procedure, the forecasters are not required
    to send it at 12:00 pm. Nonetheless, the timestamp in the data is preconfigured
    to say it is issued at 12:00 pm in the GeoJSON product. Subsequent amendments
    to existing Thunderstorm Outlooks are issued on an as-needed basis during the
    day. Each amendment generates a new GeoJSON file and graphical product. The Thunderstorm
    Outlook may not be updated with active severe weather alerts. Users are asked
    to check with the latest watches and warnings for the most current conditions.
