        is computed similarly to the SPI. The main difference is that SPI assesses
        precipitation variance, while SPEI also considers demand from evapotranspiration
        which is subtracted from any precipitation accumulation prior to assessment.
        Unlike the SPI, the SPEI captures the main impact of increased temperatures
        on water demand.

        occurs almost every day somewhere in Canada. For the purpose of identifying
        and tabulating daily extremes of record for temperature, precipitation and
        snowfall, the Meteorological Service of Canada has threaded or put together
        data from closely related stations to compile a long time series of data for
        about 750 locations in Canada to monitor for record-breaking weather. Virtual

        a best estimate of the amount of precipitation that occurred over recent past
        periods of 6 hours. The estimate integrates data from in situ precipitation
        gauge measurements, weather radar and numerical weather prediction models.
        Geographic coverage is North America (Canada, United States and Mexico). Data
        is available at horizontal resolution of 10 km. Data is only available for
        the surface level. Analysis data is made available four times a day for 6h
        intervals. The preliminary estimate is available approximately 1h after the

- description: The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is a scale designed to help quantify
    the quality of the air in a certain region on a scale from 1 to 10. When the amount
    of air pollution is very high, the number is reported as 10+. It also includes
    a category that describes the health risk associated with the index reading (e.g.
    Low, Moderate, High, or Very High Health Risk). The AQHI is calculated based on
    the relative risks of a combination of common air pollutants that are known to
    harm human health, including ground-level ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen
    dioxide. The AQHI formulation captures only the short term or acute health risk
    (exposure of hour or days at a maximum). The formulation of the AQHI may change
    over time to reflect new understanding associated with air pollution health effects.
    The AQHI is calculated from data observed in real time, without being verified

    total precipitation change (%) for 1948-2012 based on Canadian gridded data (CANGRD)
    are available, at a 50km resolution across Canada. The relative trends reflect
    the percent change in total precipitation over a period from the baseline value
    (defined as the average over 1961-1990 as the reference period). Annual trends
    of mean surface air temperature change (degrees Celsius) for 1948-2016 based on
    Canadian gridded data (CANGRD) are available at a 50km resolution across Canada.
