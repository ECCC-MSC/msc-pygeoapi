        The first are Daily Climate Stations producing one or two observations per

        selection are listed as below. The priorities for inclusion are as follows:

        (3) Stations that are co-located with the categories above and supplement
        the period of record'

- description: The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is a scale designed to help quantify
    the quality of the air in a certain region on a scale from 1 to 10. When the amount
    of air pollution is very high, the number is reported as 10+. It also includes
    a category that describes the health risk associated with the index reading (e.g.
    Low, Moderate, High, or Very High Health Risk). The AQHI is calculated based on
    the relative risks of a combination of common air pollutants that are known to
    harm human health, including ground-level ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen
    dioxide. The AQHI formulation captures only the short term or acute health risk
    (exposure of hour or days at a maximum). The formulation of the AQHI may change
    over time to reflect new understanding associated with air pollution health effects.
    The AQHI is calculated from data observed in real time, without being verified

- description: Gridded annual mean temperature anomalies derived from daily minimum,
    maximum and mean surface air temperatures (degrees Celsius) and anomalies derived
    from daily total precipitation is available at a 50km resolution across Canada.
    The Canadian gridded data (CANGRD) are interpolated from homogenized temperature
    (i.e., AHCCD datasets). Homogenized temperatures incorporate adjustments to the
    original station data to account for discontinuities from non-climatic factors,
    such as instrument changes or station relocation. The anomalies are the difference
    between the temperature for a given year or season and a baseline value (defined
    as the average over 1961-1990 as the reference period). The yearly and seasonal
    temperature anomalies were computed for the years 1948 to 2017. The data will
    continue to be updated every year. For precipitation, the Canadian gridded data
    (CANGRD) are interpolated from adjusted precipitation (i.e., AHCCD datasets).
    Adjusted precipitation data incorporate adjustments to the original station data
    to account for discontinuities from non-climatic factors, such as instrument changes
    or station relocation. The anomalies are the percentage difference between the
    value for a given year or season and a baseline value (defined as the average
    over 1961-1990 as the reference period). The yearly and seasonal relative precipitation
    anomalies were computed for the years 1948 to 2014. The data will be updated as
    time permits.

- description: The Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA) produces a
    best estimate of the amount of precipitation that occurred over recent past periods
    of 24 hours. The estimate integrates data from in situ precipitation gauge measurements,
    weather radar and numerical weather prediction models. Geographic coverage is
    North America (Canada, United States and Mexico). Data is available at horizontal
    resolution of 15 km. Data is only available for the surface level. Analysis data
    is made available once a day for the 24h intervals. A preliminary estimate is
    available approximately 1h after the end of the accumulation period, and revised
    6h after in order to assimilate gauge data arriving later.

- description: The Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System (CanSIPS) carries
    out physics calculations to arrive at probabilistic predictions of atmospheric
    elements from the beginning of a month out to up to 12 months into the future,
    resulting in seasonal forecasts. Atmospheric elements include temperature, precipitation,
    wind speed and direction and others. This product contains raw numerical results
    of these calculations. Geographical coverage is global. Data is available on a
    grid at a horizontal resolution of 2.5 degrees and 1 degree and for a few selected
    vertical levels. In addition, forecast probabilities for below, near, and above
    normal temperature and precipitation are available at both resolutions. Predictions
    and corresponding hindcast are made available monthly.
