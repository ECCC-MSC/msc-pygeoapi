        description: Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD) are climate station datasets that incorporate adjustments (derived from statistical procedures) to the original historical station data to account for discontinuities from non-climatic factors, such as instrument changes or station relocation. Data are provided for temperature, precipitation, pressure and wind speed. Station trend data are provided when available. Trends are calculated using the Theil-Sen method using the station's full period of available data. The availability of trends will vary by station; if more than 5 consecutive years are missing data or more than 10% of the data within the time series is missing, a trend was not calculated.

        description: Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD) are climate station datasets that incorporate adjustments (derived from statistical procedures) to the original historical station data to account for discontinuities from non-climatic factors, such as instrument changes or station relocation. Data are provided for temperature, precipitation, pressure and wind speed. Station trend data are provided when available. Trends are calculated using the Theil-Sen method using the station's full period of available data. The availability of trends will vary by station; if more than 5 consecutive years are missing data or more than 10% of the data within the time series is missing, a trend was not calculated.

        description: A Virtual Climate station is the result of threading together climate data from proximate current and historical stations to construct a long term threaded data set. For the purpose of identifying and tabulating daily extremes of record for temperature, precipitation and snowfall, the Meteorological Service of Canada has threaded or put together data from closely related stations to compile a long time series of data for about 750 locations in Canada to monitor for record-breaking weather. The length of the time series of virtual stations is often greater than 100 years. A Virtual Climate station is always named for an “Area” rather than a point, e.g. Winnipeg Area, to indicate that the data are drawn from that area(within a 20km radius from the urban center) rather than a single precise location.

        title: Air Quality Health Index – Forecasts
        description: The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is a scale designed to help quantify the quality of the air in a certain region on a scale from 1 to 10. When the amount of air pollution is very high, the number is reported as 10+. It also includes a category that describes the health risk associated with the index reading (e.g. Low, Moderate, High, or Very High Health Risk). The AQHI is calculated based on the relative risks of a combination of common air pollutants that are known to harm human health, including ground-level ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide. The AQHI formulation captures only the short term or acute health risk (exposure of hour or days at a maximum). The formulation of the AQHI may change over time to reflect new understanding associated with air pollution health effects. The AQHI is calculated from data observed in real time, without being verified (quality control).

        description: The Global climate model scenarios dataset is based on an ensemble of global climate model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Multi-model ensembles of modelled output (actual value) and projected change (anomaly) are available for historical simulations and three emission scenarios at a 1x1 degree grid resolution. Projected changes are expressed as anomalies with respect to the reference period of 1986-2005. A range of percentiles across the multi-model ensembles are available for download.

Multi-model ensembles of modelled output (actual value) and projected change (anomaly) are available for historical simulations and three emission scenarios at a 1x1 degree grid resolution. Projected changes are expressed as anomalies with respect to the reference period of 1986-2005. A range of percentiles across the multi-model ensembles are available for download.

        description: The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is computed similarly to the SPI. The main difference is that SPI assesses precipitation variance, while SPEI also considers demand from evapotranspiration which is subtracted from any precipitation accumulation prior to assessment. Unlike the SPI, the SPEI captures the main impact of increased temperatures on water demand.

Homogenized climate data incorporate adjustments to the original station data to account for discontinuities from non-climatic factors, such as instrument changes or station relocation. Annual trends of relative total precipitation change (%) for 1948-2012 based on Canadian gridded data (CANGRD) are available, at a 50km resolution across Canada. The relative trends reflect the percent change in total precipitation over a period from the baseline value (defined as the average over 1961-1990 as the reference period). Annual trends of mean surface air temperature change (degrees Celsius) for 1948-2016 based on Canadian gridded data (CANGRD) are available at a 50km resolution across Canada. Temperature trends represent the departure from a mean reference period (1961-1990).

        description: The Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA) produces a best estimate of the amount of precipitation that occurred over recent past periods of 24 hours. The estimate integrates data from in situ precipitation gauge measurements, weather radar and numerical weather prediction models. Geographic coverage is North America (Canada, United States and Mexico). Data is available at horizontal resolution of 15 km. Data is only available for the surface level. Analysis data is made available once a day for the 24h intervals. A preliminary estimate is available approximately 1h after the end of the accumulation period, and revised 6h after in order to assimilate gauge data arriving later.

        title: Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA) 6 hours accumulation at 15 km
        description: The Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA) produces a best estimate of the amount of precipitation that occurred over recent past periods of 6 hours. The estimate integrates data from in situ precipitation gauge measurements, weather radar and numerical weather prediction models. Geographic coverage is North America (Canada, United States and Mexico). Data is available at horizontal resolution of 15 km. Data is only available for the surface level. Analysis data is made available four times a day for the 6h intervals. A preliminary estimate is available approximately 1h after the end of the accumulation period, and revised 6h after in order to assimilate gauge data arriving later.

        title: Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System
        description: The Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System (CanSIPS) carries out physics calculations to arrive at probabilistic predictions of atmospheric elements from the beginning of a month out to up to 12 months into the future. Atmospheric elements include temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction and others. This product contains raw numerical results of these calculations. Geographical coverage is global. Data is available on a grid at a horizontal resolution of 2.5 degrees and for a few selected vertical levels. Predictions and corresponding hindcast are made available monthly.
